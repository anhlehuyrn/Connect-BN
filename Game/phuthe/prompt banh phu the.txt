Bánh Phu Thê 2 game prompt
Build a step-by-step cooking simulation “Phu The” with a cultural, festive feel. Prioritize clean UX, proportional image scaling (no distortion), responsive layout, and smooth feedback. Use Phaser 3 or a similar HTML5 game framework.

Core requirements
Framework: Phaser 3 (recommended) or equivalent HTML5 engine with scene management.

Aspect ratio: Always preserve image proportions. Use fit scaling (contain) with centered alignment; never stretch to fill. Prefer display-size changes over texture resampling where possible.

Responsive: Target a default stage size of 900×600, scale to viewport using FIT/CONTAIN and CENTER_BOTH. Maintain consistent tap/click targets on mobile.

Background: Use a cultural, festive backdrop (soft gradient with subtle motifs). Keep contrast and readability for text.

Start/replay: Include a Start Game button on the entry screen and a Replay button in the final screen.

Flow: Scenes in order: Start → Filling → Dough → Wrapping → Steaming → End.

Interactions: Drag-and-drop for ingredients/leaf/dough; click/tap for Stir/Mix/Wrap/Steam; hold-press for steaming; progress bars and hints per step.

Localization-ready: Prepare UI text for Vietnamese and English.

Audio: Light UI sounds for clicks, progress completion, and success; subtle ambient kitchen/steaming loop with volume control.

Performance: Preload, trim transparent backgrounds, and reuse textures; avoid layout jank; keep total asset weight reasonable.

Scene blueprint
Start scene (title and entry)
Title: “Bánh Phu Thê 2” with short subtitle about tradition.

Background: Gradient + soft cultural motif (e.g., banana leaf pattern or wedding ornament).

Buttons:

Start Game: Proceeds to Filling scene.

Language toggle: VI/EN switch (optional).

Help: Short overlay explaining controls (drag, click, hold).

Scaling: Center content; apply fit scaling. Buttons minimum size 44×44 px tap targets.

Filling scene (cook the mung bean filling)
Header: Step label and brief instruction (“Drag ingredients into the pan, then click Stir.”).

Objects:

Pan: Center-right, acts as drop zone. Display size scaled proportionally.

Ingredients list: Left column with draggable PNGs: mung beans, sugar, shredded coconut. Set interactive with grab cursor.

Stir button: Below pan; enabled only when all required items are in the pan.

Progress bar: Visual progress of stir-cooking (smooth tween).

Hints: Dynamic text listing missing items or next action.

Feedback:

Drag success: Highlight/tint and snap to random offset inside pan.

Stir: Animate pan texture and ingredient visibility; show progress and a completion tip when done.

Score/state: Add points on completion; set a flag that filling is ready; expose a “Next” button when done.

Dough scene (mix the batter)
Header: Step label and brief instruction (“Click Mix repeatedly to reach the right consistency.”).

Objects:

Bowl: Center; cycles through mix frames on each click.

Mix button: Click to increment progress and animate (press effect).

Progress bar: Scales to show percent complete.

Visual frames: A small set of textures (e.g., 4) to simulate thicker batter.

Completion: Show tip (“Smooth, elastic batter achieved.”) and auto-transition or Next button.

Score/state: Add points on completion.

Wrapping scene (select leaf, place dough, wrap)
Header: Step label and instruction (“Choose the correct banana leaf, place the dough in the center, then click Wrap.”).

Objects:

Wrapping slot: Center rectangle or decorative pad.

Leaves: Two draggable options: correct banana leaf and an incorrect alternative. Only the correct one should proceed.

Dough ball: Draggable, enabled only after correct leaf is placed.

Wrap button: Advances through folding frames (multi-click).

Animation frames: Sequence showing folding steps; final texture becomes finished wrapped cake.

Feedback:

Correct leaf: Confirmation hint; incorrect leaf triggers a gentle corrective message.

Wrap progression: Each click advances the wrapping frame; hide leaf/dough once folding begins.

Score/state: Add points on completion; proceed to steaming.

Steaming scene (hold press to steam)
Header: Step label and instruction (“Hold the Steam button to cook the cake.”).

Objects:

Steamer: Center image (proportional scaling).

Steam button: Interactive; on pointerdown start a timer; on pointerup check if target hold threshold reached.

Progress bar: Fills while held; slight decay if released too early; add subtle steam particle or glow effect when near completion.

Completion: On reaching the hold threshold, trigger success and transition to End.

Score/state: Add a larger point value for successful steaming.

End scene (celebration and replay)
Visuals: Display the finished cake and a celebratory banner/message.

Cultural tip: Text explaining the symbolic meaning of Bánh Phu Thê in weddings.

Buttons:

Replay: Resets score and flags; returns to Filling scene or Start scene.

Language toggle: Optional.

Accessibility: Ensure color contrast and legible fonts; avoid rapid flashing.

UI and scaling rules
Proportional scaling:

Always use aspect-preserving transforms. In Phaser, prefer setDisplaySize with original aspect or scale uniformly (same x/y).

Contain strategy: Compute scale = min(targetW/sourceW, targetH/sourceH); center via dx/dy offsets.

No distortion: Never set different scaleX/scaleY values; avoid stretching backgrounds—use tiled patterns or gradients.

Drag targets:

Hit areas: Slightly larger than visual bounds for mobile ease.

Snap: On drop into zone, snap to random offset for natural look; keep within zone bounds.

Buttons:

Size: Minimum ~128×64 logical pixels; add 1–2 px focus ring and press animation (scale to 0.95, quick yoyo).

State: Disabled (lower alpha) until prerequisites met; enable/disable based on scene state.

Systems and data
Global state:

Fields: score, fillingReady, batterReady, wrapped, steamed, language.

Reset: On Replay, reset all flags and score.

Scoring:

Filling: +20

Dough: +20

Wrapping: +20

Steaming: +40

Localization:

Text keys: Store all strings (headings, hints, button labels, tips) in a dictionary for VI/EN; swap by language state.

Audio:

UI: Click/complete sounds.

Ambient: Light kitchen loop, fade-in/out.

Steaming: Soft steam sound during hold; stop on release/success.

Asset guidance
Aspect-preserved sizes:

Ingredients/leaves/dough: ~256×128 or 128×128; keep transparent padding minimal; trim background.

Tools (pan/bowl/steamer): ~512×256 or 512×512 depending on shape; export at 2× for crisp scaling.

Buttons: ~128×64; consistent style.

Animation frames: ~256×256; aligned consistent pivot/center.

Final cake: ~512×512 for the End scene.

Optimization:

Trim transparency: Remove uniform background; center and fit into target bounding boxes while preserving aspect ratio.

Atlas: Optional texture atlas for smaller loads; ensure frame names are consistent.

Quality and accessibility
Feedback:

Visual: Tints, subtle particles, scaling tweens.

Text: Real-time hints and tips per step.

Accessibility:

Contrast: Ensure text readability on gradients.

Motion: Keep animations gentle; allow reduce-motion toggle if possible.

Controls: All actions usable with mouse/touch; consider keyboard shortcuts for Start/Replay.

Deliverables
Playable build: HTML file with embedded scripts or bundled assets.

Scenes implemented: Start, Filling, Dough, Wrapping, Steaming, End.

Config: FIT scaling, CENTER alignment, proportional image handling.

Assets: PNGs trimmed and centered; consistent look and sizing.

Localization: VI/EN support ready.

Replay and Start buttons: Working and visually clear.

Documentation: Short README explaining controls and flow.
